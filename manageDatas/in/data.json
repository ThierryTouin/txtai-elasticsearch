When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler's (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it's just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willié learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.",

In the first match, Japan easily defeats the USA 3:0 and in the second match Europe loses 2:3 against South America. In the final round S.A. shows their \"soccer cyborg\" Carlos Santana, a more than supreme player who seems to be undefeatable. All their classical tricks like Hyugas \"Tiger Shot\" or Tsubasas \"Top Spin\" seem to be totally worthless, but in a hard and spectacular match the Japanese learn more and more to play in unison and finally they get the win.",
